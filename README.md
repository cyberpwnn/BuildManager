# BuildManager
Build Constructivley, not destructivley! With the BuildManager, you can assign multiple builders different builds with descriptions, duedates, locations, warps and more! Only Build Managers can create builders, which allows control. The build manager will also notify the apropriate members of information that is important to them. For example, builders should know when their due date or location is changed, however, if they where not assigned to that build, there is no point for them to know. 
The Build Manager uses the chat Json features a lot, meaning you can click on buttons to navigate where you want. This makes it very easy to use without the hassle of too many commands.
